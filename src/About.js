    <h4>Welcome to our new review website! We are so happy to welcome you to this page. </h4>

    <h4>Our facebook page is very close to 
    100k members which can make it very hard to find certain products which ends up with a lot of duplicate posts of people
    asking the same questions.</h4>
    <h4>This website will act to minimise that. </h4>

    <h4>Here you will be able
    to add a product (if it hasn't already been added) and then you and others can review and give opinions on that product. 
    </h4>
    
        
    <h4>Don't forget to join our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/861997640563323/">Facebook Group</a> or just search "Beauty Boxx" on Facebook!  </h4>
